# Task 1.1 Inheritance and polymorphism (LEVEL 1) exercises 1 and 2.

- Exercise 1
In a music band, there are different types of musical instruments. There are wind, string, and percussion instruments.

All instruments have as attributes their name and price. In addition, they have a method called play(). This is abstract in the instrument class and, therefore, must be implemented in the child classes. If a wind instrument is being played, the method should display on the console: "A wind instrument is playing", if a string instrument is being played: "A string instrument is playing", and if a percussion instrument is being played: "A percussion instrument is playing".

The class loading process only takes place once. Demonstrate that loading can be triggered by the creation of the first instance of this class or by accessing one of its static members.

Search for information about initialization blocks and static blocks in Java.

- Exercise 2
Create a class "Car" with the attributes: brand, model, and power. The brand must be static final, the model static, and the power final. Demonstrate the difference between the three. Is there any that can be initialized in the class constructor?

Add two methods to the "Car" class. A static method called brake() and another non-static method called accelerate(). The accelerate() method should display on the console: "The vehicle is accelerating" and the brake() method should display: "The vehicle is braking".

Demonstrate how to invoke the static and non-static methods from the main() of the main class.

# Task 1.1 Inheritance and polymorphism (LEVEL 2)

- Exercise 2
Create a class "Car" with the attributes: brand, model, and power. The brand must be static final, the model static, and the power final. Demonstrate the difference between the three. Is there any that can be initialized in the class constructor?

Add two methods to the "Car" class. A static method called brake() and another non-static method called accelerate(). The accelerate() method should display on the console: "The vehicle is accelerating" and the brake() method should display: "The vehicle is braking".

Demonstrate how to invoke the static and non-static methods from the main() of the main class.

## Project Description üìú

This repository contains a series of specialization exercises in Java. The main goal is to practice, learn, and understand programming logic.

## How to Navigate the Repository? üó∫Ô∏è

The exercises are organized into folders. Each folder corresponds to a topic or a specific exercise.

* /src/tareasnivel1: Contains all the source code of the Apps.
* /ejercicio1: Contains the source code of the first exercise.
* /ejercicio2: Contains the source code of the second exercise.
* /src/tareasnivel2: Contains all the source code of the App.

## Instructions for Reviewers ‚úçÔ∏è

Thank you very much for taking the time to review my code! üòä To ensure the review is as requested, please focus on the following points:

* Best practices: Does the code follow Java conventions? (Variable names, methods, etc.).
* Logic and efficiency: Is the solution correct and does it work? Could it be done in a simpler or more efficient way?
* Code clarity: Is it easy to read and understand? That would really help me improve as a programmer.

Leave your feedback

Please leave your comments and suggestions by creating an "Issue" in this repository. If it‚Äôs a comment on a specific line, you can do it directly in the "commit" or in the file.

## How to Run the Exercises? üöÄ

To compile and run these exercises, you will need:

* Java Development Kit (JDK), version 11 or higher.
* An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA
 or Eclipse
.

Simply clone the repository, open the project in your IDE, and run the main file of each exercise.
